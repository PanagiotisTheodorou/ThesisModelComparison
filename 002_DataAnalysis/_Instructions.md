# Data Analysis  

This folder is dedicated to a deeper understanding of the dataset. The primary focus is on analyzing aspects such as feature distribution and class dominance.  

## Key Analyses  

The following analyses are performed in this folder:  

- **Feature Importance** (`AnalyzeFeatureImportance`): Determines which features are most important to the classification.  
- **Class Imbalance** (`CheckClassImbalance`): Identifes imbalances.  
- **Class Imbalance Without Majority** (`CheckClassImbalanceWithoutMajority`): Analyzes class distribution after removing the majority class.  
- **Feature Correlation** (`CheckCoorelationBetweenFeatures`): Examines relationships between features.  
- **Feature Distribution** (`CheckFeatureDistribution`): views how each feature is distributed.  
- **Multi-Class Distribution** (`CheckMultiClassDistribution`): Investigates how different classes are spread within the dataset.  
- **Scatter Plot Analysis** (`ScatterPlotAnalysis`): Generates scatter plots for relationships.
